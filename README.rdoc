1. Use bundler to install gems
	bundle install
	bundle update

2. Start the development server to localhost:3000

3. When a user needs to be set as an admin, in the console the user.admin boolean needs to be set to true.
	rails c
	usr = User.find(id) #with id being whatever integer is in the show page url for a user ('/users/33' would be 33)
	usr.admin = true
	usr.save
